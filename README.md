## üöÄ What‚Äôs different in this fork?
Add customizable hyperlink fields and social icons to the signature builder, introduce a new template, and refactor form and component handling for cleaner state management.

### New Features
- **Customizable field text colors**  
  Add a `color` attribute to **BasicTool** and UI controls to pick **default / main / secondary** text colors for form fields.
- **Configurable label separators**  
  Choose a **label separator** in options and apply it across signature templates.
- **Hyperlink field type**  
  New `hyperlink` field supports **title**, **underline**, and **label-based hyperlink display** in signatures.
- **Custom social icons**  
  `SocialLinkInput` lets users select defaults or supply **custom icon URLs**.
- **New template: Template10**  
  Registered and available for preview.

### Enhancements
- Refactor initialization with `watchEffect` to set **default field properties**.
- **Dynamic text color** computed in `Field` and `JobFields` based on selected options.
- `getAnchorAttrs` now accepts `{ color, analytics }` and unifies `href` assignment.
- `FormItem` simplified with a computed item; streamlined Basic Tool updates.
- Replaced `SocialUrlInput` with `SocialLinkInput` in social lists.

### Build / Docs / Chores
- **Docs:** Added `labelSeparator` options to attributes data.
- **Chores:** Expanded `useSignatures` availability to include **SignatureTemplate10**.
- **Build:** Updated `tsconfig.json` (target **ESNext**, module resolution, includes) and added base **tailwind.config.js**.
- **Output:** HTML generator renders both default and custom icons as email-safe `<img>` tags.
- **State:** JSON state loader/downloader + reactive signature store via `useSignatureData`.
